## Masculinity Survey Study: Analyzing the other beliefs and traits of men who feel at risk of sexual harassment accusations in the work place

This project investigates the social and emotional beliefs of U.S. men
in relation to masculinity, consent, and perceptions of accusations of sexual harassment, using data from FiveThirtyEight’s 2018
“What It Means to Be a Man” survey. This project explores patterns of
emotional expression, consent behaviors, and workplace-related
attitudes. The final goal is to build a predictive model identifying
which beliefs and behaviors are most associated with men who feel at
greater risk of being accused.

-   [Project 1](Project1) will have an explanation of the data source,
    variable dictionary, and all preprocessing steps used to clean and
    prepare the data for analysis.

-   [Project 2](Project2) is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), including
    visualizations and summary statistics related to emotional behavior,
    consent, and workplace beliefs. It focuses on univariate and
    bivariate insights.

-   [Project 3](Project3) plans to use logistic regression to explore which variables are associated with feeling “at greater
    risk of being accused of sexual harassment.” This project will also summarize key
    EDA findings among at-risk respondents and provides interpretations of the model output and consent-related behaviors.
